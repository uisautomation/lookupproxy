=========

This is the documentation for the :py:mod:`lookupproxy` project which provides
a proxy for the University of Cambridge Lookup API. The body of the reference
material can be found in the section on the :py:mod:`lookupapi` application.

If you don't know where to start then :doc:`the getting started guide
<gettingstarted>` is a good bet.
