The lookupapi Application
=========================

The :py:mod:`lookupapi` application provides a REST-y API which proxies the
University of Cambridge `Lookup API
<https://help.uis.cam.ac.uk/email-telephony-and-collaboration/map-collaborative-services/lookup/ws>`_.
Currently only the anonymous API is proxied but access to the API is protected
by requiring an OAuth2 token with the appropriate scopes
(:py:attr:`lookupapi.views.REQUIRED_SCOPES`). The OAuth2 token is verified by
means of a third-party OAuth2 `token introspection
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662>`_ endpoint.
